# Data_Vis_Final
Final project for Tulane Data Visualization 2021
Background: 
The Barataria Preserve, a unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, is representative of many south Louisiana freshwater coastal wetland landscapes threatened by relative sea level rise. The overall goal of this project is to better understand surface hydrology dynamics in the Barataria Preserve. Between 2013 and 2015, twenty-seven water-level loggers were installed along three transects (Transects 1, 2, 3). The loggers record hourly measurements of water level and temperature at each location. The purpose of this analysis is to create a visualization that will allow us to better understand the movement of water through the park over a given period of time.

Methods:
Data has been collected from 2014 to present. The data contains elevation, date, and well ID. The language of choice to handle this dataset was python. There are a total of five wells loaded into this dataset to make it more manageable with the hopes of scaling up to cover all 27 wells. Each well has an individual dataset that had to be manually checked before adding to a master dataset. Once added the cells were formatted and ordered. 

Packages needed:
PANDAs, PLOTLY, DASH The use of PANDAs was especially needed to group and sort the data, PLOTLY is used to create the graphing parameters and DASH was used as a powerful tool to    display multiple sets of data to allow for comparisons.
