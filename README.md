# Data_Vis_Final
Final project for Tulane Data Visualization 2021
Background: The Barataria Preserve, a unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, is representative of many south Louisiana freshwater coastal wetland landscapes threatened by relative sea level rise. The overall goal of this project is to better understand surface hydrology dynamics in the Barataria Preserve. 

Methods: Data has been collected from 2014 to present. The data contains elevation, date, and well ID. The language of choice to handle this dataset was python. 

Packages needed: PANDAs, PLOTLY, DASH
The use of PANDAs was especially needed to group and sort the data into something useable. This will also be used for future analysis by being able to look at specific year ranges and frequencies of data.  
DASH was used as a powerful tool to display multiple sets of data to allow for comparisons.
